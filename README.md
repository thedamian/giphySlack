# giphySlack
Just some fun giphy and slack integration

## WHY????
When Doug Roberson (the CTO of Shelly) brought us a shelly button (along with some other goodies for some IoT training)... 
I knew that the button had to be used for some good old fashion random gifs on our #humor channel 
on slack!

## Button Info
Here's the button. SUPER easy. Connect it to wifi (with the mobile app) then you have four options and just a url that get's hit for each of the options (click, double click and long click and double click)
